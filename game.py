TODO

[?] Discard pile of cards (?)

[X] Use (Int?)Enums to represent the stages of the game

[X] End game: restart variables, accumulate points, etc.

[X] Move all DixitGame-related operations when a new stage is started currently
    in main.py to methods of the class itself (DixitGame.voting_turn(),
    DixitGame.storyteller_turn(), etc.)
    [X] start_game() (now new_game())
    [X] play_game() (now start_game())
    [X] storytellers_turn()
    [X] player_turns()
    [X] voting_turns()
    [X] point_counter()

[ ] Store game history for future analysis?

[/] Be forgiving to mistakes: allow players to overwrite the cards and choices
    they made (Cards can be overwritten so long a new stage hasn't been triggered)
