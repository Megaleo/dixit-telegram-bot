TODO

[ ] Discard pile of cards (?)

[ ] Use (Int?)Enums to represent the stages of the game

[ ] End game: restart variables, accumulate points, etc.

[ ] Move all DixitGame-related operations when a new stage is started currently
    in main.py to methods of the class itself (DixitGame.voting_turn(),
    DixitGame.storyteller_turn(), etc.)
    [X] start_game()
    [X] play_game()
    [X] storytellers_turn()
    [X] player_turns()
    [X] voting_turns()
    [X] count_points()
    [ ] others?

[ ] Store game history for future analysis?
